Hello, I'm Ali Fanyani 👋

I'm a passionate computer science student at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Iran, with a fervent interest in all things programming.
Originally hailing from the picturesque city of Jahrom, nestled in the heart of Fars province near Shiraz,
I bring a blend of cultural richness and technical acumen to the table.

About Me

🔭 I’m currently focusing on mastering the art of front-end development.

🌱 I’m enthusiastic about learning and exploring new technologies.

💻 My favorite languages include Python, HTML, and CSS.

🎨 The name "Greenhawk" has been my moniker of choice since childhood, inspired by my love for both the color green and the majestic hawk.

💪 When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can find me passionately pursuing my other passion: bodybuilding.
